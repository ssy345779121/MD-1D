# MD-1D
Use the Verlet algorithm to solve the 1D crack propagation problem. Consider a linear chain of atoms lying on an adhesive substrate, with atomic bonds much weaker than the interatomic bonds within the chain. The interatomic interaction inside the chain can be described using a harmonic spring and the adhesion to the substrate is described using the Heaviside function.
